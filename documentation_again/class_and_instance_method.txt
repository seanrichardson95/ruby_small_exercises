Directions:
Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

My original answer:
`File::path` returns the string representation of the path. It takes an argument, the path, and returns a string.

`File#path` returns the pathname used to create file as a string. In the example, the method gets called on a filepath and takes no arguments.

LS answer:
File::path is a class method, so it gets called on a class.

File#path is an instance method, so it gets called on an object.

:: signifies class method
# signifies instance method.
