Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

The method has been depracated. Here's some old documentation for it:

Discussion
If you go to the YAML documentation (it's part of the Standard Library API), you will find a page that is almost completely devoid of useful information. There's not a single method described, and only 3 ridiculously trivial examples. There is no Parent class defined, there are no Included Modules, and the YAML-related links on the left-side are of no help.

The only really useful item on this page is the 3rd paragraph:

The underlying implementation is the libyaml wrapper Psych.

The key here is the reference to Psych. If you go back to the Standard Library API page and click on psych, you see a long list of Psych-related classes. Unfortunately, that long list makes a quest for a method named ::load_file somewhat daunting.

Fortunately, this page also lists all of the methods in the different classes, and up near the top of this list is ::load_file, which is part of the Psych module. Sure enough, there's the documentation for what we were looking for.

In fact, the entire Psych class is about methods that will be useful when working with YAML files.
