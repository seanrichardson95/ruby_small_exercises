# Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as arguments. This method should return true if the search value is in the array, false if it is not. You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

# include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
# include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
# include?([], 3) == false
# include?([nil], nil) == true
# include?([], nil) == false

# > Understanding the problem
# Input:
#   -Array
#   -Search value
# Output:
#   -True if search value found in array
#   -False otherwise
  
# > Algorithm
# -Use any? 

def include?(arr, value)
  arr.any? {|element| element == value}
end
