# > Directions
# Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

# You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

# Examples
# word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
# word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
# word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

def word_cap(str)
  str.split.map {|word| word.capitalize}.join(" ")
end

puts word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
puts word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
puts word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'
